In India, balancing a nutritious diet while considering cultural preferences and environmental sustainability is increasingly challenging. This project introduces an Indian Balanced Diet Recommender System designed to provide nutritionally balanced meal plans with a low carbon footprint. Leveraging a K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) model, the system customizes recommendations based on user preferences, including dietary restrictions such as allergies, vegetarian/non-vegetarian choices, and regional cuisines. The primary goal is to keep daily caloric intake within the recommended range of 2000-2500 kcal while ensuring that the suggested diets are culturally relevant and environmentally sustainable.
By addressing the diverse dietary needs and preferences across different regions of India, this recommender system offers a tailored approach to dietary management.
